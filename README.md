# AI-Sales-Call-Assistant-
Overview
This project involves creating an AI-driven assistant that analyzes real-time speech during sales calls. The system processes audio input from the microphone, transcribes it to text, performs sentiment analysis on each conversation chunk, and provides a summary of the entire call. The data is then stored in a Google Sheet, enabling easy review and analysis of the conversation's tone and content.
